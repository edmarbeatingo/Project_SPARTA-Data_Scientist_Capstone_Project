This study aims to analyze earthquake data provided by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) using machine learning algorithms to predict the recurrence of earthquakes in specific locations.
The dataset available on Kaggle, titled "Philippine Earthquakes from PHIVOLCS," offers a structured collection of seismic events recorded by PHIVOLCS from 2016 onwards. It includes columns such as date, time, magnitude, depth, location, and coordinates (latitude and longitude), similar to the information presented on the PHIVOLCS website. The predictive model aims to identify patterns, trends, and high-risk areas, thereby assisting in disaster preparedness and response strategies.
